      "We talked about the vintage stores continuing to comp at very nice pace. Sentiment(polarity=0.78, subjectivity=1.0)\n",
      "But the 2013-2014 class, although they came out of the ground stronger than our model, you can expect them probably to comp a little bit slightly less, but still comping very well, and at or above our kind of guidance that we've comped and we've spoken of in the past of a comp.

      "But nonetheless, we've seen some decline or even seen some flattening of the tenders to slightly decline, but mostly flat, so still some escalation in the breast market, in the whole chicken market. Sentiment(polarity=-0.14791666666666664, subjectivity=0.41041666666666665)\n",
      "What we understand at this point is that will still continue to be at the higher point, but coming down potentially in the back half of the year, with the caveat of reverse migration in Avian flu, any kind of scares that may come from that.

      "Sort of first year, we've actually seen kind of all three kind of come in and play at the same time. Sentiment(polarity=0.29, subjectivity=0.4716666666666667)\n",
      "So, again, I'd point you back, I believe that COGS will come down and be flat to last year and slightly under the 32%, but I think Q3 is still going to be a little high. Sentiment(polarity=-0.05353174603174603, subjectivity=0.241031746031746)\n",

      "So I'm curious on kind of the updated thoughts there. Sentiment(polarity=0.25, subjectivity=0.95)\n",
      "And then separately, you mentioned you didn't expect to take any more price for the year, that maybe more commodity-driven. Sentiment(polarity=0.5, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "But I'm curious if you would consider maybe into 2016 taking more price if you were to see wage inflation or overall labor cost inflation continue to rise in a more structural basis. Sentiment(polarity=0.225, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n",
      "Yeah, I think it's kind of the way we looked at this year is exactly what you said on the commodity side. Sentiment(polarity=0.425, subjectivity=0.575)\n",
      "We've been able to see some significant savings there as we've negotiated our contracts and continue to negotiate. Sentiment(polarity=0.4375, subjectivity=0.75)\n",
      "So that's the main reason there. Sentiment(polarity=0.16666666666666666, subjectivity=0.3333333333333333)\n",
      "If we were to see whether it be commodity or labor pressures, we would consider taking price. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "I think kind of the way we look at it is we do research every year at the beginning of the year, and we're really four weeks away from taking price at any given point in time. Sentiment(polarity=0.4, subjectivity=0.55)\n",
      "So if we needed to do it even in the back half of this year, we could do that. Sentiment(polarity=-0.08333333333333333, subjectivity=0.08333333333333333)\n",
      "Our intent is not to do that, though. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "In 2016 again we will reevaluate that. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "We will have some menu introduction in 2016 as well, so some price kind of comes through a new menu innovation. Sentiment(polarity=0.36818181818181817, subjectivity=0.6772727272727272)\n",
      "So we would definitely consider price as we do every year. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller\n",
      "And just to add on to your initial question about training stores or three-GM stores, at the end of the second quarter, we had 19 stores that were currently staffed with three GMs. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.13333333333333333)\n",
      "At that same point in the prior year, we only had 9. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.375)\n",

      "James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller\n",
      "Yeah. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",

      "Hi, good afternoon. Sentiment(polarity=0.7, subjectivity=0.6000000000000001)\n",
      "Kevin, I just wanted to maybe ask about the same-store traffic trends being up just about 1% in the quarter. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "How do you think about that kind of growth, and what is your overall expectations for the businesses as you look forward, not only in the second half of this year but longer term in terms of your ability to grow the traffic number? Sentiment(polarity=0.08666666666666667, subjectivity=0.4133333333333333)\n",
      "Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n",
      "Yeah. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "We continue to think it's going to be very positive. Sentiment(polarity=0.29545454545454547, subjectivity=0.7090909090909091)\n",
      "And I know I keep beating the dead horse here, but so much of our traffic is dumped into mix. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.30000000000000004)\n",
      "So we kind of look at it together when we look at roughly the 3.5% of mix and the 1.3% of traffic. Sentiment(polarity=0.25, subjectivity=0.65)\n",
      "So it's very organic, again pointing back to very little marketing spend driving this. Sentiment(polarity=-0.014583333333333337, subjectivity=0.31666666666666665)\n",
      "So it's really that brand awareness and everything that's going. Sentiment(polarity=0.2, subjectivity=0.2)\n",
      "So we expect it to remain positive and continue kind of on those same trends throughout the back half of the year and even going into next year. Sentiment(polarity=0.1101010101010101, subjectivity=0.289520202020202)\n",
      "I think you could even – hopefully, we'll see some acceleration again as we continue to penetrate and build some of the smaller markets with more locations. Sentiment(polarity=0.25, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "Dallas is our biggest, and we've seen that now since 2009 continue where traffic and mix continued to grow. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)\n",
      "Got it. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "That's helpful. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "And then I guess a follow-up question on SG&A. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "I know that you're still at a very small scale today and there is a lot of investments needed as you scale up the business. Sentiment(polarity=-0.325, subjectivity=0.52)\n",
      "But how do you think about that line as you look into maybe next year or the following couple of years, and your ability to leverage that. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.05)\n",
      "Do you think that the level of investment growth will start to slow and we'll start to see leverage on that or do you it will be more modest leverage as you scale up? Sentiment(polarity=0.09999999999999998, subjectivity=0.6)\n",
      "Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n",
      "Yeah, I think again it's – we're very excited to be SOX compliant. Sentiment(polarity=0.48750000000000004, subjectivity=0.9750000000000001)\n",
      "We're happy that we're in the big league now with the other folks. Sentiment(polarity=0.225, subjectivity=0.4916666666666667)\n",
      "It was a little quick, so that acceleration that you're seeing this year obviously will continue on as we go forward. Sentiment(polarity=0.048611111111111105, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "So there will be a little bit there that was unanticipated. Sentiment(polarity=-0.1875, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "As soon as it was, we anticipate it to be there but not as soon as we are. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "So with that, we'll continue to invest there. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "So you probably won't see – I think we've always pointed 2015, no acceleration, and maybe slight 2016 is what we said. Sentiment(polarity=-0.16666666666666666, subjectivity=0.16666666666666666)\n",
      "I don't know now as we continue to build everything around SOX and our requirements if we will see as much in 2016. Sentiment(polarity=0.2, subjectivity=0.2)\n",
      "But I do believe after 2016 – maybe slightly in 2016, you'll start to see that grow through 2017 and out at a nice pace. Sentiment(polarity=0.21666666666666667, subjectivity=0.5833333333333334)\n",
      "And kind of the way we originally had modeled it out as is if you kind of take 75% of the revenue growth and model that in, that's kind of how we've looked at the leverage over time. Sentiment(polarity=0.54375, subjectivity=0.8624999999999999)\n",
      "But probably seeing that more in 2017. Sentiment(polarity=0.5, subjectivity=0.5)\n",

      "Hey, Paul. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\n",
      "My first question is on a little bit more color on the operating expense line. Sentiment(polarity=0.1875, subjectivity=0.4444444444444444)\n",
      "I know you mentioned it was up 140 basis points year-over-year if you exclude the impact of the manager meeting. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "It still seems – a little more color other than higher occupancy expense could maybe help out. Sentiment(polarity=0.109375, subjectivity=0.46875)\n",
      "And the 2Q number, even adjusted, was higher than the 1Q number, which hasn't been the case in the past. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.375)\n",
      "So just trying to get a feel where that number is heading and maybe some commentary on the second half whether you expect that line to be levered or maybe see some deleverage? Sentiment(polarity=-0.08333333333333333, subjectivity=0.08333333333333333)\n",
      "James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller\n",
      "Yeah, thanks, Paul, this is Jim. Sentiment(polarity=0.2, subjectivity=0.2)\n",
      "A lot of the store operating expense line comes down to really the comparison year-over-year. Sentiment(polarity=0.022222222222222213, subjectivity=0.24444444444444446)\n",
      "Last year, we had bit more volatility as we mentioned due to issues with our maintenance provider. Sentiment(polarity=0.125, subjectivity=0.3138888888888889)\n",
      "What that resulted in was some inconsistencies from quarter-to-quarter primarily in the repair and maintenance line. Sentiment(polarity=0.15000000000000002, subjectivity=0.25)\n",
      "In the current year, with service channel in place, it's giving us much more insight into our expense, helping us really monitor the expense. Sentiment(polarity=0.2333333333333333, subjectivity=0.3666666666666667)\n",
      "But what we're seeing this year is a very normalized flattened-out expense as opposed to some of the up-and-down spikes that we saw in the previous years. Sentiment(polarity=0.016666666666666677, subjectivity=0.23333333333333334)\n",
      "So I think what you'll see for the remainder of this year is a much more normalized line on that operating expense, especially R&M, and it's going to lead to much more, much better comp for next year. Sentiment(polarity=0.3, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "Thanks. Sentiment(polarity=0.2, subjectivity=0.2)\n",
      "I recall last year – this was in the third quarter – had some actual – some spiking higher expenses in that line. Sentiment(polarity=0.0625, subjectivity=0.16666666666666669)\n",
      "Was that...\n",
      "James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller\n",
      "That's exactly right. Sentiment(polarity=0.2857142857142857, subjectivity=0.5357142857142857)\n",
      "In the third quarter we did see some of the uptick back up in the R&M. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "So, obviously, there's a hope that we'll be much a closer percentage next year. Sentiment(polarity=0.06666666666666667, subjectivity=0.2333333333333333)\n",
      "But on that same token, in the fourth quarter of last year, we saw the R&M tick back down. Sentiment(polarity=-0.031111111111111117, subjectivity=0.09611111111111112)\n",
      "So like I said, there was just a lot of inconsistencies in the prior-year number, and I think what we'll see is a nice flatter line this year and going forward. Sentiment(polarity=0.25, subjectivity=0.5)\n",

      "You have seven already opened this – so far in the quarter. Sentiment(polarity=0.1, subjectivity=1.0)\n",
      "Should we expect any more for the third quarter, new units as far as modeling? Sentiment(polarity=0.18409090909090908, subjectivity=0.48863636363636365)\n",
      "Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n",
      "Yes, we have a couple of more coming into – roughly three to four coming into Q3 that we'll finish up, and then we'll finish the rest in Q4. Sentiment(polarity=0.2, subjectivity=0.45)\n",
      "Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\n",
      "Great. Sentiment(polarity=0.8, subjectivity=0.75)\n",
      "And then looking out to next year's development, still looking for maybe 25% of total development being in new markets. Sentiment(polarity=0.04545454545454545, subjectivity=0.40151515151515155)\n",
      "And would you qualify just Denver and KC to make up those roughly eight stores in new market that was (39:17). Sentiment(polarity=0.018181818181818174, subjectivity=0.42727272727272725)\n",
      "Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n",
      "That's correct. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "I think those would be the two markets that you'll see that new development. Sentiment(polarity=0.13636363636363635, subjectivity=0.45454545454545453)\n",
      "And as we talked, it was up to 25%. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "In 2015, the only new store that will be opened in the new market is the Kansas City store, so you can assume that the rest of the stores were all in existing markets. Sentiment(polarity=0.0909090909090909, subjectivity=0.6363636363636364)\n",
      "But in 2016, you will definite see that 25% number going out because of the sites that we already have signed in both Kansas City and in Denver alike. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\n",
      "Great. Sentiment(polarity=0.8, subjectivity=0.75)\n",
      "And then maybe lastly just on your comp guidance for the year, you've obviously raised it on a full-year basis. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.2833333333333333)\n",
      "It kind of implies a range maybe somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.5% to 5.5% for the rest of the year. Sentiment(polarity=0.6, subjectivity=0.9)\n",
      "And maybe just talk about what might have occurred to put you in the low end or high end, and maybe how we should think about it. Sentiment(polarity=0.08, subjectivity=0.41999999999999993)\n",
      "Obviously, your 2Q comp is slightly above that range now. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.3)\n",
      "And I know some price is falling off, but should we look at it on a two-year basis or if things are good, we'll land here, or roughly, something like – yeah? Sentiment(polarity=0.3, subjectivity=0.5)\n",
      "Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n",
      "Yeah. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "I think, Paul – I mean, I think, barring any kind of macroeconomic things, I think you're going to see us continue the trends we have. Sentiment(polarity=0.14375, subjectivity=0.79375)\n",
      "We feel very confident in that 5% to 6% range. Sentiment(polarity=0.65, subjectivity=1.0)\n",
      "Kind of back to the two-year stats we've kind of really been in that 13%-ish kind of range for a while, kind of low double-digit two year stat. Sentiment(polarity=0.37142857142857144, subjectivity=0.5857142857142856)\n",
      "So we feel very confident that moving through Q3-Q4 we're going to remain in that same range. Sentiment(polarity=0.325, subjectivity=0.5625)\n",
      "James Besch - CFO, Vice President-Accounting & Controller\n",
      "Yeah. Sentiment(polarity=0.0, subjectivity=0.0)\n",
      "And just to add to that keeping in mind, we won't have price in the second half of the year. Sentiment(polarity=-0.08333333333333333, subjectivity=0.08333333333333333)\n",
      "So if you were really looking at – within that implied rate, it definitely does imply kind of a 3.7% to 5.7% type of range. Sentiment(polarity=0.26666666666666666, subjectivity=0.5333333333333333)\n",
      "Kevin Miles - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director\n",
      "Yeah just a point – one other point, I think, it's roughly – in Q3-Q4, it's roughly 70 basis points of price that's rolled off, if you kind of adjust for the back half of the year of the 1.3% price overall. Sentiment(polarity=0.015476190476190473, subjectivity=0.32023809523809527)\n",
